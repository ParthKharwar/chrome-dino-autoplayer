# Chrome Dino Game - Autoplayer

A small naive code project that automatically plays the dinosaur game built into Google Chrome.

## Requirements

- Google Chrome
- Python and Pip
- Python Virtual Environment

## Installation

- Create and activate your virtual environment
- Install dependencies using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Running the Autoplayer

- Open Chrome and go to `chrome://dino`
- Run your code in a terminal
- Alt tab to your Chrome instance
- Press space to start the game once

## Limitations and Drawbacks

- The code is currently a little dependent on luck, with the highest score I've reached being 1526
- The bounding box is hard coded to my screen size
- The approach to obstacle detection is naive
